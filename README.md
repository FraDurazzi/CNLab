### How to execute the code
The notebooks can be executed and edited online on Google Colab by changing "github.com" to "githubtocolab.com". If you do so, remember to save the changes you made in your personal Google Drive.

Each notebook can also be downloaded as "raw file" on students personal computers, please do it just before lecture to be sure it is updated to the last version. To download a notebook, access to it in Github, then at top right you will find a download icon that will say "Download raw file" when hovering. Once downloaded, the notebook can be opened with Jupyter notebook, that comes together with Python in the Anaconda/Miniconda distribution. Personally, I prefer to open it in VSCode as editor.
