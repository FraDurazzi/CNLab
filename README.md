### How to execute the code
The notebooks can be executed and edited online on Google Colab by changing "github.com" to "githubtocolab.com". If you do so, remember to save the changes you made in your personal Google Drive.

The repository can also be cloned on students personal computers, please do it just before lecture to be sure it is updated to the last version.
